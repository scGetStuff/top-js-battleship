# top-js-battleship
The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Testing JavaScript, Project: Battleship

### First pass

-   Using Jest to test modules only, not anything in UI.
-   I have Jest and Webpack set up for ES6 modules.
-   Using factory functions for this project.

TODO
- I probably don't have enough tests, I am not getting into TDD unless somebody is paying me
- board needs report method to return if all ships sunk; for game loop to call
- create player module; record hit/miss on shot grid of the players board
- AI will be random first
- game loop
- add ability to place ships; start with static
- UI

The default parameters all over the place are because I haven't switched to typescript yet, I do it to kind of define types for parameters
